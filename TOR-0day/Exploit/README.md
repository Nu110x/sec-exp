This is an Javascript exploit actively used against TorBrowser NOW. It
consists of one HTML and one CSS file, both pasted below and also
de-obscured. The exact functionality is unknown but it's getting access to
"VirtualAlloc" in "kernel32.dll" and goes from there. Please fix ASAP. I
had to break the "thecode" line in two in order to post, remove ' + ' in
the middle to restore it. - SIGAINT
